Low intermediate frequency (low-IF) receivers are the most used architectures in modern wireless communications, for instance in the growing market of Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
The QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) is used in several communication systems, such as digital TV, digital radio, high-speed internet services, and other systems with a high data rate requirement. The main reason for its adoption is its high spectral efficiency.
This documentation covers the main blocks used in a 16-QAM communication system.
